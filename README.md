# MovingJpegs_Samsung
This is a tool to split a Samsung "moving" image into a jpeg image and a mp4 movie

This is a cheap hack, it will take one option of a filename of the file to split
apart.  The original file should not be altered, it will create (or OVERWRITE) 
a output.jpg and output.mp4.

If the files output.jpg and output.mp4 exist it will over write them!!!!

I found this repo useful.

  A repo for Windows application to strip the jpeg and the mp4 apart.
